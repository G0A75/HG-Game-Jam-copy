Morgan Jumps

### Game Summary (1-sentence pitch):
Platformer with time travel mechanics

### Theme / Genre

Main theme(s): 
- tldr version: Your game should follow a theme of time dilation, project hopping or nonlinear thought. You may use just one or multiple to get max points. Or you can ignore the theme completely, and make what you want - theme is only 15% of the score.

- Longer version: Your game is about fictional HG community member, Morgan (with apologies to anyone actually named Morgan). Morgan can be your main character, the one playing the game, or it could be something that reflects their experiences. You can include them literally as a named character, or use this loosely as a guideline and not include the name - up to you! 

- Time moves strangely for Morgan - hours can feel like minutes, and deadlines appear suddenly (time dilation) *
- Morgan has a collection of half-finished projects that each felt like the most important thing in the world when they started (project hopping) 
- Morgan connects dots others don't see, creating insights through unconventional mental paths. (nonlinear thought)
